    /*
    Write a JavaScript program in a single HTML file (embed your script)
    named power.html that does not require input that uses a loop to build 
    a single string output of all powers of 2 from LaTeX: 2^02 0 up to LaTeX:
    2^{31}2 31, inclusive. You can choose to use a button to call a function
    or have no function and just run the code. Your choice.
    The output must have the following format:  1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2147483648
    where there is a comma and space between each value and there is no comma
    after the last value. Your output does not need to be green.
    Notation Help in case you are not familiar with standard notations: The
    dot dot dot (...) in the example output references that fact that there
    are a lot of values between the two example output values.
    Submit your HTML document that contains your HTML interface and embedded
    JavaScript code.*/
